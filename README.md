### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student<br />
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores<br />
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers<br />

### ACs
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br />
WHEN I click the start button<br />
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br />
WHEN I answer a question<br />
THEN I am presented with another question<br />
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br />
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br />
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br />
THEN the game is over<br />
WHEN the game is over<br />
THEN I can save my initials and score<br />
